Modernizing a suite of web and android applications aimed at municipality operations. Examples are: waste collection, mowing, sweeping, road de-icing, etc.

I'm the tech-lead of a team of 6 developers. Next to programming I also advise the company on technology, development process, security, and operations.

Together with the team I'm leading an effort to modernize all applications in an effort to break through to international markets. This means completely rewriting all the applications in a [modern programming framework](/2023/05/27/effective-dotnet-web-development.html) as well as unifying the applications into a more monolithic structure.

## Technologies

I'm working with: C#, .NET Framework, .NET Core, Microsoft Azure (App Services, Servicebus, Storage Account), PostgreSQL, Duende Identity Server, Microsoft Active Directory, Microsoft Azure DevOps (Repositories, Pipelines).
