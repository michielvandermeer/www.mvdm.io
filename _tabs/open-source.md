I contribute to and maintain several open source projects. Here are some highlights:

## My Open Source Projects

### [Hotwire.NET](https://github.com/mvdmio/Hotwire.NET)

A NuGet package that brings Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) to ASP.NET applications. This enables Rails-like development speed while staying in the .NET ecosystem.

### Other Contributions

Check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mvdmio) for more projects and contributions.

## Philosophy

I believe in giving back to the community. Open source has been instrumental in my career, and I try to contribute whenever I can, whether through code, documentation, or helping others.
