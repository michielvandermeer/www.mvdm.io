**Confident your app works; the first to know if it isn't.**

Health Check let's you know everything is OK with your app, and alerts you when there is an outage. You'll know about the issue before customers start calling and you'll have it fixed before your users notice.

Health Check is currently in **Open Beta**. You can register your account for free; no credit card required. When the beta ends you will be asked if you want to continue using Health Check or if you would like to stop. Continuing will mean that you'll subscribe to a paid plan. I have not yet determined the pricing.
