Translation Tools makes translating software seamless. It allows non-developers to edit translations without having to know anything about the tools that are normally used by programmers.

Translation Tools is currently in **Open Beta**. You can register your account for free; no credit card required. When the beta ends you will be asked if you want to continue using Translation Tools or if you would like to stop. Continuing will mean that you'll subscribe to a paid plan. I have not yet determined the pricing.

## Features

Translation Tools integrates directly with your Git repository. It will find all the translation files in your repository and present the keys and values in a grid for easy editing. You can invite anyone you want into your account to participate in translating. They won't need to download any tools and there's no need for importing and exporting any files.

Not sure about how to translate a phrase? No worries; Translation Tools suggests fitting translations based on the other languages you already have translated. No need to switch between Google Translate and Translation Tools all the time.
